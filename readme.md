# let's stare at the sun

this is trying to do a few things:

1. figure out what from [this "js stack from scratch" project](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) i actually want to use. so far i've found myself wanting these things:
    - babel for bleeding edge javascript features on the server and the client
    - webpack for bundling code together into a single js file that just works
    - the general project structure

2. build something that uses the suncalc library to figure out when the sun is going to be coming into my window
